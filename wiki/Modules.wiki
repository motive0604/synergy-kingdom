= CIFS =
This module lets you access windows networking shares on your phone.  To use, 

{{{
busybox mount -t cifs -o user=usernamehere,password=passwordhere,uid=1000,gid=1015,file_mode=0775,dir_mode=0775,iocharset=utf8,nodfs //192.168.1.0/sharename /sdcard/smb/
}}}

replace usernamehere, passwordhere, with SMB username/pass
      192.168.1.0 with your server IP address
      /sdcard/smb/ with the directory to symlink to

now you can use a filebrowser and navigate to /sdcard/smb and you will see your windows network files. 

Tested playing a 350mb divx file over an adhoc wifi network using rockplayer and all worked fairly well :)
