#All about "Godmode"

= Introduction =

in a nutshell we are setting up a yaffs2+ext2 partition. The concept I based this mod on was was originally presented by Hansung Chun written up [http://events.linuxfoundation.org/slides/2011/abs/abs2011_chen.pdf here]  This combines yaffs for wear leveling ontop of ext2 for performance.

Quadrant shows a overall increase of 700-1000 points, and a 10x IO increase!  There is no overclocking involved here at all.

= Geek details =


During upgrade we _attempt_ to keep your existing data.  I dd the /data part to an img file on the sdcard, format /data then copy the img file back and convert to ext2.  *This process will take some time on flash.*  also remember to have atleast 450MB free on your sdcard for tempspace going to the ext2 img.


After the rom is installed the old yaffs2 partitions are changed to mount on /cache0, /data0, /system0.  The ext2 img files on those partitions are mounted on /system, /data, /cache.  If you have issues booting, please also include with logcats the following details:

{{{
adb shell df
adb shell busybox mount
}}}
