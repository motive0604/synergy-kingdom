Details on how to use custom modules and services


= CIFS =
This module lets you access windows networking shares on your phone.  To use, 

{{{
busybox mount -t cifs -o user=usernamehere,password=passwordhere,uid=1000,gid=1015,file_mode=0775,dir_mode=0775,iocharset=utf8,nodfs //192.168.1.0/sharename /sdcard/smb/
}}}

replace usernamehere, passwordhere, with SMB username/pass
  192.168.1.0 with your server IP address
  /sdcard/smb/ with the directory to symlink to

now you can use a filebrowser and navigate to /sdcard/smb and you will see your windows network files. 

Tested playing a 350mb divx file over an adhoc wifi network using rockplayer and all worked fairly well :)

= openvpn =

After you have openvpn setup (i tested with pfsense + openvpn export package) dump you ovpn and key files on /sdcard/openvpn/

start openvpn settings, select your ovpn file and connect.  

= dropbear =

to use-

in dc.conf make sure the following is set to 1:
setprop dc.service.dropbear.enabled 1;

remount your system part rw
{{{
adb shell remount
}}}

adb shell into your phone and set a STRONG root password
{{{
adb shell passwd
}}}

reboot your phone.  Now open up a SSH client such as putty.  connect to your phones ip address which can be obtained by running 
{{{
ifconfig
}}}

login as root with the password you just set.  enjoy full bash with autocomplete, nano, vim, etc :)


= DYNDNS = 

now that you have dropbear, lets get shell everywhere (providing your not behind a restricted NAT, i tested over 3g fine)

1) go to dyndns.org and register for a dynamic hostname.  
2) edit /system/etc/inadyn.conf your file should look like this, replacing exmamples out.  update period is in MS
{{{
--username SynergExampleUser --password SynergExamplePass --alias synergyromexample.dyndns.org --background --update_period 6000
}}}
3) now edit /system/etc/dc.conf, change 
  setprop dc.service.inadyn.enabled 0; to setprop dc.service.inadyn.enabled 1;
4) reboot and enjoy your dynamic ip.  you can now SSH into your dyndns name from anywhere (make sure you set a strong password n00bs)


= LOSTPHONE = 

Team synergy wrote a custom lostphone script and will be expanding on it to do different things.  for now it just grabs the last weather sync city/state/zip.  more will come soon :D

just ssh into your dynamic hostname and run 
{{{
lostphone
}}}
